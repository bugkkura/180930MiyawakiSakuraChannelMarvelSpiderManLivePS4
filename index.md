Hello! This site was created to make it easier for Sakura fans to find Sakura contents. This is all new to me as I am a total noob at coding so  I will be slowly updating this site to include more stuff (eg. variety shows, VLIVE, ENOZI, theatre performances etc. that Sakura has appeared in). If you have any suggestions to improve this site or would like to help out with anything, do contact me <a href="https://twitter.com/bugkkura"> @bugkkura</a>.

In the meantime, do continue supporting Sakura! ðŸ¥°
